"EcoVault" is smart contract wallet using the Safe SDK that can calculate a user's carbon footprint and offset it by buying carbon credits from verified sources. It will also include a feature for users to donate a portion of their transactions to a charity of their choice, creating a more transparent and accountable donation process. It will provide a user-friendly and secure way for users to manage their cryptocurrency while contributing to environmental and social causes.


## Problem we solves

- Current financial systems and wallets do not have a built-in mechanism for calculating carbon credits of current addresses or facilitating donations to charities, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability in these areas. 
- Additionally, there is a need for a way to visualise and analyse the donations made by users to charities, making it more transparent thanks to blockchain. 
- There is a need for a secure and user-friendly green smart contract wallet that can not only store cryptocurrency but also help users calculate and offset their carbon footprint, donate to charities of their choice, and visualise and analyze their donations.
Having such features in the wallets would make more people aware of the environmental crisis and push them to solve it. 


## How it will work 

- The green smart contract wallet will be built using the Safe SDK and the Ethereum, Solana. The carbon credit calculation and the offsetting process will be implemented through a smart contract, with data provided by verified carbon offset providers provided by Change API. 
- The charity donation feature will also be implemented through a smart contract, allowing users to select from a list of verified charities and allocate a percentage of their transactions to their chosen charity. 
- The wallet will be accessible in real-time and can be used to securely manage cryptocurrency, calculate carbon credits, offset them, and donate to charities.


## How web3 is involved

- Web3 technology, which includes Ethereum, Solana and smart contracts, provides a secure and transparent way to manage cryptocurrency and execute transactions. 
- It also allows for the creation of decentralized applications that can facilitate complex financial transactions, such as carbon credit calculation and charity donations, in a trustless and transparent manner. By leveraging the power of web3 technology, the green smart contract wallet can provide a secure and user-friendly way for individuals and organizations to manage their cryptocurrency while contributing to environmental and social causes.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Green smart contract wallet will be built using the Safe SDK and the Ethereum blockchain. Carbon credit calculation and offsetting will be facilitated by integrating with carbon offset providers, and the donation feature will be implemented through smart contracts. 
Other potential tools and frameworks that may be utilized include web3.js, Solidity, React, and Hardhat.
